Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3ft. The bed is only accessible from one side. If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up. The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head. We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly weren't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war. Adding, a few euros isn't going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have.","Dungeons, Drain Flies and Centipedes",,A Traveler,,,,0.5462060000000001,,,,0.872607

The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours.

I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere.

The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action.

We made the reservation Friday night, and honestly, was apprehensive because of some of the reviews. Pleasantly surprised! The place was clean, it's had a facelift and looks good. The bathroom tub could use an update...but I have stayed in the W in downtown Chicago and the tub was worse and room was horrible. I'd take this room over that one any day! The breakfast the next morning was good. Nothing to write home about, but it offers a great selection and the eggs weren't watered down. Sausage was good...bacon...well, that looked and smelled like a dog treat. Passed on that one. But the coffee was decent and overall, was very pleased with our last minute choice to stay there...would do it again and would recommend others!

Just make sure to wear or bring socks but worry not as they sell socks if you happen to forget. We all enjoyed our stay. From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports. The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women. Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kids/young adults doing their horsing around or whatever. Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it.

I will say the bathrooms are very small (when you open the door there is only about 5 inches from the door to the toilet). The vanity and mirror is spacious, but definitely not for 2 people at once. The Trellis Spa and service from its staff is impeccable, and the gym and outdoor amenities makeup for the age of the hotel.

The only things that I considered to be under what I paid was the bed and room itself. The bed was terribly uncomfortable. The pillows were hard and lumpy...like when you wash and then high heat dry artificial pillow stuffing and it melts together. The AC unit didn't really work. It just blew air. I was hoping it would cool down to kill the mildew smell, but it never did. The worst was that every time the AC unit kicked off, a noise would start (I'm assuming some kind of duct work) that sounded like someone was knocking at my door.

The only very minor service/room condition complaints we had were that one of the electrical outlets was pulling out of the wall, that we had to call to request replacement shampoo/conditioner the second night, and also when we requested pool towels shortly before pool closing, we were asked to go to the front desk to get them, as they could not bring them down to the pool towel cabinet for us at that time (no big deal unless you're already wet from the pool, of course!)

I liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows. The buffet breakfast was extensive including fruit, eggs and sausage (as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker) and low-sugar syrup. What was strange was how closely the breakfast bar attendant watched my every move. I think she was trying to be responsive, but she asked me what I was looking for every time I glanced at the selections. The cons for me were the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness. I have never cited cleanliness in a review-I can let a lot of things pass. But I cannot accept obvious, fresh stains on both the bath vanity and kitchenette counter, especially when they wipe away easily with water, suggesting that not even a rag was dragged across them. The hotel staff was very nice, but always a turn-off for me when they walk in from their cigarette break at the front of the hotel as you walk in behind them. Surprisingly this hotel and the Wingate were nearly equally ranked (and priced) on this site. They are not similar in quality. I checked out the Wingate while in town. It has a much nicer lobby and breakfast room, where a hot breakfast is provided, not a continental as described. The room I was shown had newer furniture, granite kitchenette counter and tile tub/shower surround.

Upon arrival there was 3 people in front of us in line. All 3 people were there to complain and to ask for their money back. There was 2 people wanting their money refunded due to bed bugs that they had found in their room and another asking for a refund because the hotel was unable to give them the accommodations that were promised. The man at front desk was very argumentative and rude. When it was our turn we immediately explained that we were a little nervous to stay based on what we just witnessed. His logic was we might as well stay here because he was not going to give our money back and in addition to that he was insisting that we pay him 20 in cash because our child is 15 and anyone over 14 must pay additional charge. I again explained that we was just worried about bed bugs and he said that it was fine because he had called exterminator and thus had done everything he could. He was unreasonable and rude. I left the lobby in tears. We decided to inspect the room and found items that had been left there from the previous customers all over the room. In my opinion anyone considering this hotel for your vacation should just keep looking.,Web pics are fake! Run away!,,melissa,,0.643986,,0.649307,0.855231,0.5649270000000001,,

I'm used to staying in MUCH nicer hotels, but for a somewhat last minute trip and wanting to be close to the beach and center of town its what We settled for. The pool was decent and I think it was heated at night. The room was not the best, it was somewhere to sleep and put our stuff, is what it was. Nothing fancy or extra AT ALL. the sheets had a hole and they were not changed everyday. And there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed. We had to febreeze it( it had a stale smell) and I wiped down the room myself when we got there.( for my own assurance) But we still stayed for 4 nights 5 days. We went to target,radio shack, a little grocery shopping and the mall (with Dave and busters) ect. and the furthest we ever drove was still less then 10 mins. And the beach and broad walk was a half a mile down the street. I personally would never choose to stay here again but it wasn't the worst either. Like I said it was somewhere to stay and so affordable (under our normal hotel budget) and location wise, it was great, we were in the middle of everything.

My room (classic) was fine, even though the layout of it was unfortunate, but the hotel is old and I guess they can't help the big pilar in middle... I booked through Hotels.com and asked for a quiet room. They remembered this and gave me a room on the street side, which was definitely quieter. In addition, the room had a separate door leading to the bedroom, which made the experience quieter. The breakfast was great and included sparkling wine. I enjoyed the fresh fruit and croissants! I wasn't that impressed by dinner, however. I had a steak, which was cooked as I asked, and the wine was good with it, but the list overall just wasn't to my taste. The pool area only have staff bringing out the lounge chair mattresses at 10am though, so if you're earlier than that you have to bring your own towel from your room and settle with that... this was a bit disappointing. Also while they serve you drinks and snacks to your lounge chair, they will not come to you to take your order - you have to go to the bar yourself. The fitness room is by the pool and separated by glass (leading to the pool). It's clean with towels, but there is no air conditioning and only 3 pieces of equipment. Overall a brilliant hotel!

I wasn't impressed by the location as the main entrance is off a rather run down street. The back was nicer as it was on the marina but it was a fairly long, hot walk to all the major attractions. My room was more than adequate and looked like it had been recently updated. The view was grim but I didn't pay for a sea view so I was stuck looking at concrete. I like to work out first thing in the morning but I couldn't use the tiny gym because it was out by the pool and didn't open until 10am and breakfast (which I'd paid for in my room rate) was served 7.30-10.30 so time was not on my side. The breakfast was nice but I would not have paid the 29 that was quoted on the menu. The view from the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the best things about the hotel. I'm very glad I wasn't there high season as the hotel is literally right beside Tito's a very popular nightclub. I did hear some noise a couple of times in my room at night but luckily it seemed to be people walking by the back of the hotel so it didn't last long. The pool was nice- lots of loungers. The staff were fairly friendly on the whole. I had room service once and it was of good quality. I didn't like the 4.50 service charge to bring it to my room and then having the guy hanging there expecting a tip. They charge for practically everything.

We wanted to celebrate our anniversary at a nice hotel in Mallorca but it was subpar at best. Hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the rooms smell pretty bad. They also used this very heavy fragrance which made staying at all common areas, such as lobby or bars, quite unbearable. To make things worse, there was a post in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room. The hotel told us that we had to pay extra in order to change the room as that was the only room available for the price that we paid. One can probably find a much better hotel for the price you pay for this hotel. Service can certainly improve as well. Location is quite awkward as well. It's about 40 minute walk to the city centre and it's not close to the beaches either.

We never ate dinner in the main restaurant but the breakfast had an excellent choice everything from full cooked English to fresh fruit, natural local yoghurt and lots of cereals or pastries. The Cava on ice was a nice touch. The rooms are modern but with an old world charm, from the1930s () marble style bathrooms to solid wood writing desks and comfortable arm chairs. Comfortable beds, plenty of hot water and wifi in the rooms. Overall the decor and furnishing in this hotel speaks of solid old fashioned quality in a modern well-run establishment. Sure if you look at your feet as you walk, you will see the odd threadbare carpet in the corridors but it completely fits with the feel of a well-loved lived in country mansion that isn polished from top to bottom daily.

She had been to this hotel and was delighted when I chose it. Breakfast was amazing - there was nothing else they could have added to such a comprehensive choice. We had one evening meal which was delicious and the waiting staff were charming and attentive. The only criticism I have is that the wifi is not up to today's requirements. I am sure that many guests like me want to take advantage of Netflix which is now available in Europe and it was very frustrating to keep dropping the signal and having to wait or abandon the exercise entirely.

The room was extremely small and was not the one I booked per the picture. I had to go in sideways into the bathroom and though things are small in general in Europe, the localization and the price I paid for this hotel room justifies a bigger bathroom door in the very least. Though the breakfast was varied and they do speak English, they could not make (regardless of language spoken), I am fluent in 2 and also speak some italian, they could not figure out how to make scrambled eggs!! Oh they had them, the ones you make from powder. Anywho, the staff is kind of uptight, though they play it like if they are actually being friendly.

The male consierge was more than helpful when we arrived and upon departure. However, when I phoned before to confirm our reservation, older female consierge was not very pleasant and it was easy to pick her out when we were there in person. The younger female consierge was very helpful in contrast. The hotel lobby is large, elegant, and the hotel bar, bartender, were fantastic. The aperitivo was mostly breads with various topping, but good. The room itself, for a superior, was stuffy, overpriced, the bed was worn and too soft, the bathroom way too small for one person let along two people to move around in at the same time. Had to take the toilet paper off the roll to keep it dry while showering, water went everywhere. The refrigerator needed to be defrosted so wasn't cooling properly, which we used to keep our bottled water cool. Didn't need the mini bar so moved some things out to make room. Also the water wasn't working for a few hours that afternoon, for whatever reason, so no flushing, no washing hands, the maid came late in the afternoon to make up the room, not her fault though.","Old hotel , superior room way overpriced",,Littlebits,,,0.614528,,,,,

We stayed during first 2 weeks in November. Air conditioning had been turned off and our room and daughter's room were too hot. Hotel didn't have fans. Windows had no screens, so opening them to cool off the rooms let in mosquitoes. This was probably not an unusual problem since rooms had plug in insect repellent units. Maid service was excellent. All in all, the hotel was expensive, but worth it. The junior suite was well appointed. I understand that the star rating in Europe is different than the U.S. If you wanted year round air conditioning, you probably need a 5 star rated European hotel.",Great Location,,Bob,,,0.593895,,0.614919,,,

I didn't notice it until I pull the white sheet to check the bed. They didn't change our pillow sheet at all. I wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap hotel.

It was my first time in West Palm Beach. I was barely impressed with this hotel, being a large name brand, I expected more. The room was centrally located near the airport and highways which was great, thankfully we decided to rent a car because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel. The outside and lobby was pretty, very similar to other business hotels. I was extremely dissapointed upon check in when we realized the hotel pool was not only not in service, but it was completely empty. That was the only reason we booked this hotel was for the pool so again we had to drive to even swim on our family vacation. The room was mediocre, similar to a stay at our local hotels in the north east. The breakfast was over priced 15 per person for a breakfast buffet. Overall I would suggest not staying here while on vacation unless you are fully aware in order to do anything fun you must drive there. Also be sure to call before you check in to be sure the pool is in service.

I called for an extension I was willing to pay for and they said no. I travel a lot, and that was a first.

After returning to our room we received a call saying one was avail and we could move rooms immediately. Since this was first thing in the morning it tells me that this room was avail when we checked in. If you want a quiet hotel, DON'T stay here. When a door from a room closes or when someone walks heavy in the hall or in their room, the entire building shakes it can be heard loudly in the room next door below. There was a baseball team with kids that appeared to be 10 yrs old staying here and running wild. The noise and floor/building rattling from a baseball team running up and down the hallways was very disturbing. The parents not once told the kids to stop running. It was really sad the lack of respect being shown to other guests. We talked to the front desk and they told us that it is not their place to say anything to the kids. Yes it is!! It is up to you to ensure the comfort of all your guests and if kids are being too loud and parents aren't around, you can tell the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet.

The TV had a few basic channels, standard HBO was Spanish only, but that was fine. The pool is clean and centrally located.

The beds were comfortable, too, although more pillow options would have been even better. I like a softer pillow than what was offered, but that's my own preference. We also had some trouble with the room air conditioning system, mostly due to the remote used to operate it, which seemed simple enough and we had thought we had things running properly, until we were awakened in the night due to the room being way too stuffy. That's when we discovered the remote had a hidden flap with more buttons that we randomly pressed until the A/C fan turned on. Sometimes being high-tech can be a problem, especially without instructions. A little card in the room to explain things would have been very helpful. The hotel was nicely maintained and the lobby was warm and inviting, with friendly staff.

We returned to our room at night, after being out all day, and found the door wasn't securely shut and gave way to a simple push. Panicked, we took inventory of our possessions and luckily discovered nothing missing. I hate to think of what may have happened if an intruder entered the room and my wife returned alone. After informing the front desk, I wrote an email to the gen mngr and got a reply from their op mngr the next day. She informed me that our room had been accessed by keycards that were issued at check-in. I informed her that there was no way that we could have accessed our room during the times she gave me. She couldnt offer an explanation of how or why our door lock showed access. While we were away I know that staff had entered to clean so its safe to assume that it was staff who left the door unlocked/open. Again, a simple push opened the door so a simple push by staff to check if the door was securely shut would have sufficed to ensure our safety.

We all had black dirt and grime under our feet after only 2 hours of being in the room! The dishes in the cupboards were all dirty. ALL of them! It was so gross. There was dried food on everything. Check out was a nightmare for my mother. The two people working the front desk at check-in did not swipe our credit cards correctly and there was no record of my card ever being swiped. Which is INSANE because we actually saw them do it! At this point my family and I were already on an airplane home, so my poor mom had to check out alone and deal with this. They put the entire cost of the room on her credit card because there was no record of my card. We aren't a rich family. We saved for a very long time to afford this trip and in one swipe this Residence Inn completely ruined my mother financially.

We sat in the hallway and multiple hotel employees walked past not a single one asking us if they could help (4 adults just sitting in the hall waiting). At 4:00 we asked someone how much longer. It was not until 4:20 before we could get in the room and that was with 3 people working on it.

They refused to refund me for the night I did not use. It does state this in their bi laws, but to tell the truth, this has never happened to me before so I did not look. MY experience is it is typical for hotels to refund canceled reservations if they are 36 hours in advance. What right has a hotel to do refuse to refund w sufficient notice. That should not be legal. Would you buy clothes or tools at a shop that had no refund policy They do it because they know they are only one of two hotels in this impoverished little town. Do yourself a favor, stay an hour away in Kayenta, at Monument Valley. There's no night life in Chinle so its not like you need to be around in the evening. Also their restaurant was extremely expensive, so we did not eat there. We ate at a Chinese resturaunt on the main road. The food was typical, but the staff were fun to be around. Canyon De Chelly, however, is incredible. Don't miss that.",upset customer,,A Traveler,,,0.609977,,,,,
